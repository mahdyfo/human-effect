# Human-Effect

What makes world, good to live is its people. If we can compute human behaviours based on different impressions, thoughts and social norms, we can predict his actions. Viseversa, if we know the human behaviours of a country, we can predict the social future of that country.

Countries and governments are affected by human behaviours.
Human behaviours are affected by their characteristics.
Characteristics are affected by thoughts and experiences.
thoughts and experiences make human properties.

We start from the smallest properties and make a modular mechanism to calculate the big impacts. By defining a good relation between human features and behaviours, we are able to model a suitable society. The point is that, it is a computerized model and can assure the functionality.
