# Human-Effect

What makes world, good to live is its people. If we can compute human behaviours based on different impressions, thoughts and social norms, we can predict his actions. Viseversa, if we know the human behaviours of a country, we can predict the social future of that country.

- Countries and governments are affected by human **behaviours**.
- Human behaviours are affected by their **characteristics**.
- Characteristics are affected by **thoughts**. (experiences affect thoughts)
- thoughts and experiences make human **properties**.

We start from the **smallest properties** and make a modular mechanism to calculate the big impacts. By defining a good relation between human _properties_ and _behaviours_, we are able to model a suitable society. The point is that is a computerized model and can assure the functionality.
